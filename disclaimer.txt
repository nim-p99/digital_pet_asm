USE OF AI 
----------
- During this project, AI tools (primarily ChatGPT) were used to support our understanding of MIPS 32 
programming language concepts, such as explanations of addressing modes and clarifications of 
correct register usage.

- Additionally, AI was occasionally used to suggest potential debugging strategies.

- In instances where AI generated suggestions or example code, these were used SOLELY as reference material.

- All programme logic, structure, and final code implementation were written, tested, and refined exclusively by the group members.

- **No AI system was used to generate the final code submitted for assessment.**

EXTRA FEATURES
========================================================================

1. Persistent State Storage
---------------------------
- The programme implements a feature that allows the user to save their pet's energy state to a file (save_game.txt).
- The user can then load this state when they return to the game, allowing them to continue where they left off.

2. End-of-Game Analytics
---------------------------
- Analytics shown at the end of each game, including:
    - Total time alive
    - Final energy level
    - Number of commands entered
    - Number of resets

3. Choose Your Pet
---------------------------
- The user can select the type of pet they want to play with (cat or dog).
